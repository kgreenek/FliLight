FliLight
========

Cross platform PC software for wirelessly controlling a 3d LED cube.

It has 6 different animations that can be controlled in real time. Multiptle animations can be playing simultaneously.

It can also be configured to receive beat information from a midi port.

I use loopbe to virtualize a midi port. Then set up Traktor to output its midi beat signal to that midi port.

Once detected, the blue light in the FLiLight GUI will flash in beat, and the animations will besynchronized with the music playing.
